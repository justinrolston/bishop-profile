# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a static personal profile website for Justin "Bishop" Rolston, hosted at bishop.therolstons.com via GitHub Pages. The site is a single-page HTML application with embedded CSS styling that showcases Bishop's professional background as a Senior Software Engineering Manager and his ministry work.

## Architecture

- **Single File Structure**: The entire website is contained in `index.html` with embedded CSS
- **No Build Process**: This is a static HTML site with no compilation or build steps required
- **Deployment**: Automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using the CNAME file pointing to bishop.therolstons.com

## Development

- **Preview**: Open `index.html` directly in a browser to preview changes
- **Styling**: All CSS is embedded in the `<style>` tag within the HTML head
- **Responsive Design**: Uses CSS Grid and media queries for mobile responsiveness
- **External Dependencies**: Only uses Google Fonts (Inter font family)
